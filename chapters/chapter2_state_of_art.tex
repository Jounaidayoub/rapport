\section{Anomaly Detection Technologies}

\subsection{Statistical Approaches}

Statistical methods form the foundation of most anomaly detection systems in financial markets:

\subsubsection{Z-Score Analysis}

The Z-score method measures how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean:

\begin{equation}
Z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}
\end{equation}

Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $x$ is the observed value
    \item $\mu$ is the mean of the dataset
    \item $\sigma$ is the standard deviation
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Advantages:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Simple to implement and understand
    \item Computationally efficient
    \item Suitable for real-time processing
    \item Well-established statistical foundation
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Assumes normal distribution
    \item Sensitive to outliers in training data
    \item May not capture complex patterns
    \item Fixed threshold approach
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Moving Averages and Standard Deviation}

Moving averages provide a smoothed view of price trends and help identify deviations:

\begin{equation}
MA_n = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} P_{t-i}
\end{equation}
